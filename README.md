<h1>Hi, my name is Rodrigo Elias and Welcome to my github profile! </h1>

<h1 align="center">About my carreer</h1>
<p>
I have been programming for about 7 years, 4 of which I have worked as a web Node.js and TypeScript software developer. I have experience working on a platform for selling assistance plans, a payment machine commissioning system, and a mobile app that matches... well, used to match people needing caregivers with qualified professionals.
</p>

<h1 align="center">About me</h1>
<p>
I'm easygoing, empathetic, and enjoy mentoring less experienced developers. While I tend to be shy and quiet at first, I open up and interact more as I get to know people.
When it comes to projects, I question everything, offering constructive criticism and always proposing solutions to improve things.
On a more personal note, I'm a nerd at heart who loves video games, reading, math, anime, working out, and, of course, good food (who doesnâ€™t?).

Learn to be aware of your mental health and tiredness by YOURSELF
this guy will help you a lot if you're a weirdo/nerd, and remember that no one has the key to success, neither I nor any CEO/CTO or the fuck O you follow
